# Tennis match prediction service
# NOTE: this implementation is a heuristic / rule-based predictor (weighted combination
# of handcrafted features). Although the file previously referred to "ML", the current
# logic does not train or learn parameters from data — it uses fixed weights and
# deterministic calculations. To convert this into a true ML model you would need to
# extract features for historical matches, train a model (eg. logistic regression,
# XGBoost) and then use that trained model here.
